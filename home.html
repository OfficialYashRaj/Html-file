            Hello! My name is<strong > Yash</strong>. I am a passionate learner and aspiring <strong >software developer.</strong> 
            My journey into the world of <strong>technology</strong> has been fueled by a love for problem-solving 
            and creativity. As a <strong>CSE student</strong>, I enjoy diving deep into programming languages 
            and exploring how technology can create solutions that impact lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I am not coding, I spend my time honing skills in <strong >backend development and exploring new frameworks.</strong> 
            My interest lies in crafting seamless and efficient solutions for real-world challenges. 
            I am currently focusing on a project related to <em>real estate automation</em>, which leverages 
            technology to simplify leasing and payment processes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I strongly believe in continuous growth and learning. Whether itâ€™s exploring the intricacies 
            of data structures like <strong>stacks</strong>, or delving into the details of Java, I am always 
            eager to expand my horizons. For me, coding is not just a skill but a way to <em>create meaningful change</em>.
