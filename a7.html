            Hello! My name is <strong><span style="color:darkred;">Yash</span></strong>. I am a passionate learner and aspiring 
            <strong><span style="color:darkgreen;">software developer</span></strong>. My journey into the world of 
            <strong><span style="color:purple;">technology</span></strong> has been fueled by a love for problem-solving 
            and creativity. As a <strong><span style="color:blue;">CSE student</span></strong>, I enjoy diving deep into 
            programming languages and exploring how technology can create solutions that impact lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I am not coding, I spend my time honing skills in 
            <strong><span style="color:rgb(43, 37, 36);">backend development</span></strong> and exploring new frameworks. 
            My interest lies in crafting seamless and efficient solutions for real-world challenges. 
            I am currently focusing on a project related to <em><span style="color:teal;">real estate automation</span></em>, 
            which leverages technology to simplify leasing and payment processes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I strongly believe in continuous growth and learning. Whether itâ€™s exploring the intricacies 
            of data structures like <strong><span style="color:darkcyan;">stacks</span></strong>, or delving into the 
            details of <span style="color:darkgoldenrod;"><strong>Java</strong></span>, I am always eager to expand my horizons. 
            For me, coding is not just a skill but a way to <em><span style="color:indigo;">create meaningful change</span></em>.
